\section{Assignment Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unzip the attached \textbf{.zip} file.
    \item Create a database in your MariaDB RDBMS called ``assignment1''.
    \item Implement the methods in \texttt{App.java} according to the \texttt{TODO} comments therein.
    \item Run your code to ensure it creates the tables and pushes the data into the database tables.
    \item Use the tests in the \texttt{AppTest.java} test-suite to test your code once you've confirmed it pushes successfully.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Additional Information}

Unit tests have been provided to help you test your code as you write it.
Once all methods are completed, the test-suite should take about 4 minutes and 30 seconds to run.
